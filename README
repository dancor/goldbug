goldbug is a database creator and analyzer for go opening positions.
i'm planning to use it to gather opening statistics from a collection
on the order of 10k games.  i might add more statistical stuff later.
i'm currently using SGF files i bought from go4go; i couldn't find a
good free collection sadly.

for v1
- convert SGF files into database supporting lookups of the form
  position -> games where that position occurred
- my first attempt will be to use Data.Binary on IntMap (Set Int),
  and create a simple hash for Position -> Int
