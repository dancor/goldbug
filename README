goldbug is a database creator and analyzer for go opening positions.
i'm planning to use it to gather opening statistics from a collection
on the order of 10k games.  i might add more statistical stuff later.

current issues with v1
- game adding is quite slow.  adding ~100 games is taking many minutes.
i'm not sure if the excess time is mostly
from sgf handling or the database structure.  i could proflie or
experiment with a making a very minimal sgf parser..
there could also be a laziness issue.  also maybe the db is so large
that putting it all in memory is giving us trouble?

plan for v1 (completed)
- convert SGF files into database supporting lookus of the form
  position -> games where that position occurred
- my first attempt will be to use Data.Binary on IntMap (Int, Int),
  and create a simple hash for GamePosition -> Int

game collection notes
- i couldn't find a good free go game collection
- i'm currently using SGF files i bought from go4go
- i had to add FF[4] in the SGF files to get them to parse:
  ~ sed 's/^(;DT\[/(;FF[4];DT[/' -i ./**/*.sgf
