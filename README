goldbug is a database creator and analyzer for go opening positions.
i'm planning to use it to gather opening statistics from a collection
on the order of 10k games.  i might add more statistical stuff later.

todo
- make command-line sgf loading still enter right into interactive
  mode after?  esp bc loading takes so long.  maybe an option to not
  enter interactive mode if you don't want to?  or can just "echo q |"

current issues with v1
- game adding is quite slow/intensive
  - i think it also takes inordinately long if you add 100 or more
    games at once, so maybe a laziness perf issue there
- db loading is slow
  - can bang patterns in the db struct help?
  - maybe a completely different struct?
  - maybe need to do this part in C actually?  but hard to find a good
    trade-off of fast vs basically-everything-in-C?

plan for v1 (completed)
- convert SGF files into database supporting lookus of the form
  position -> games where that position occurred
- my first attempt will be to use Data.Binary on IntMap (Int, Int),
  and create a simple hash for GamePosition -> Int

game collection notes
- i couldn't find a good free go game collection
- i'm currently using SGF files i bought from go4go
- i had to add FF[4] in the SGF files to get them to parse:
  ~ sed 's/^(;DT\[/(;FF[4];DT[/' -i ./**/*.sgf
